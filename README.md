 Chess!
 by Adam M. Intrator

 To play against the computer using default names ("Adam" and "Flatiron"),
 simply load the 'chess.rb' file on the command line:
    ruby chess.rb

 To play against the computer with a name of your choice, add your name and
 the word "Computer" or "computer" as arguments on the command line before
 loading the file:
   ruby chess.rb player_name computer

 To play against a friend, add both names as arguments on the command line:
   ruby chess.rb Player1 Player2

 Use arrows to move the cursor, 'return' to select a square or piece.

 Good luck!
